# OnboardModal Component

## Purpose

A multi-step modal that guides users through the onboarding process after they upload files.

## When it appears

- **Initially closed** when the page loads
- **Opens automatically** when `handleUploadSuccess` is called (after successful file upload)
- **Controlled by** `showOnboardModal` state in `items-upload-client.tsx`

## Steps

1. **user-info**: Collect user name and email (skipped if already authenticated)
2. **share**: Share the uploaded memory with someone
3. **sign-up**: Create account (optional)

## Key Features

- **Conditional rendering**: Only shows for specific steps (`user-info`, `share`, `sign-up`)
- **Session integration**: Pre-fills data if user is already authenticated
- **Context integration**: Uses `useOnboarding` context for state management
- **API calls**: Updates user info and creates share links

## Props

```typescript
interface OnboardModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean; // Controls modal visibility
  onClose: () => void; // Called when modal should close
  onComplete: () => void; // Called when onboarding is finished
}
```

## Flow

1. User uploads file ‚Üí `handleUploadSuccess` called
2. `setShowOnboardModal(true)` ‚Üí Modal opens
3. User completes steps ‚Üí `onComplete` called
4. Modal closes and user is redirected to profile page
